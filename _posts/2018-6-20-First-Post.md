title: This Is A Test Post
---

This is a test post to see if **I** can create a blog entry and post it to my *GitHub* blog.

I intend on using this space for a few things.

1. To serve as a place where I can write blog posts about various data things that interest me
2. To be a place I can point potential employers to that will show case the sorts of data analysis that I can do.
..2a. Most of this work will by in **R** for now, but I hope to add **Python** in the future.
..2b. There will also be a pointer to my [Tableau Public] (https://public.tableau.com/profile/tim1747#!/) profile.

Thanks
