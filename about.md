Hi,

I am a Data Analyst living in Seattle and this is my blog about data things that catch my interest.

### More Information

Most of the data that I will be sharing here comes from my personal data tracking, the remainder will be from various public sources.

This blog is in its infancy and I will go back and build this out with more information as I have it.
