## Enabling data driven decision making in an ever changing world

### Who are you?

I am a **Business Intelligence Analyst** living in Seattle.  I help businesses turn their data into actionable information.  I have experience working with data on everything from a Mainframe information management system running on *COBOL* and *IMS Databases*, to large scale data sets with millions of rows of data, all the way down to small scale speciality data sets for modest operations.  I have experience with data in the trucking industry, insurance benefits, pharmaceutical research trials, fraud detection, and digital advertising.

### What can you do?

I work extensively with **SQL**, but also have experience with **Excel**, **Tableau**, **Greenplum**, **Microstrategy**, **R**, and **SAS**.  I like to create a report once, then automate it so that the customer gets the full value of the report, and I have more time to deliver further innovation and insights.

### Is That All?

I have worked as a programmer analyst on *COBOL* systems and made extensive use of *JCL*.  In a prior role I built out an automation system using *JAVA*, *SAS*, *MS Access*, and *Excel* to deliver over thirty daily reports before the office even opened for the day.  Having a background as programmer makes by versatile and nimble enough to be able to understand and use legacy code from other analysts.  It also gives me the ability to be able to pick-up whatever is the preferred coding system in any environment I work in.

### What is your education level?

I have three degrees at present.  But I don't anticipate adding any new ones soon.

1. **Master of Business Administration** - Webster University 2006 with Distinction, **GPA 4.00**
2. **Master of Arts in Computer Resources and Information Management** - Webster University 2004, GPA 3.94
3. **Bachelor of Science in Biology** - Oklahoma Christian University of Science and Arts 1991

I don't consider my education complete as I am an active lifetime learner.

### More Information

The intention of this blog is to discuss thing that I am learning to do.  Or to document things that I have learned in the past that I want a better record of than just the scrap of code living in a library.  The data will come mostly from my own life, or from public data sources.  There will also be some from the various educational activities I am involved in.

This blog is in its infancy and I hope to update it weekly with interesting code and analysis.
